# Conflict
The JavaScript UI framework for Discord bots

## What is Conflict?
Conflict aims to be the best JavaScript framework for making Discord bots. Most frameworks are composed of classes and based on events and functions. Conflict is different. Conflict sets up a directory structure to handle every challenging aspect of making a Discord bot, including command registration, command handling, UI structuring, events, storage, state, and even sharding. Under the hood, it's just Discord.js with superpowers.

## How can I contribute?
It's great you want to contribute! Since I probably have a lot of progress locally and it is still very much under development, so you should join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/KuAHEnbj5v).
Or, if you find a typo in any of my readmes or docs, please open a PR, because that happens too often. ü§™

## Current development state & details

`create-conflict-app` is a folder for the output produced when running the "create-conflict-app" script. It should function similar to create-react-app or create-next-app in how it creates the needed folder structure and installs the library.

`create-conflict-app/bot` is where the code for the bot is stored. It is in a sub-directory so that all files can be transpiled for JSX, therefore allowing for a more organic file structure.

`create-conflict-app/.conflict` is similar to `.next` with Next.js. It holds the output and all temporary files for conflict.

`create-conflict-app/conflict` is the folder for all of Conflict's exports and utilities. Other than `bot.js`, every file will be mapped to the `conflict/<filename>` export.

`create-conflict-app/conflict/bot.js` is the entry point, which will be mapped to the command `conflict start` and `conflict dev` in the NPM package.
